note as N9727
This "literate code map" shows the MVC-A Architecture 
which means MVC plus App Architecture.

This architectural design pattern clearly defines:

* the role mediating Controllers play
* the need for an App object
* the direction and flow of events

The App object is central to this architecture:

* holds refs to models
* creates controllers
* holds view state
* contains some business logic methods
